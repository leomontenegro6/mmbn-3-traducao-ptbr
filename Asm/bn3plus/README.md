This is a modified version of the [BN3 Plus patch](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/933/) source code, originally made by Prof. 9, and adapted for the PT-BR translation under his permission.

The changes were mostly to have the "Navi Customizer" animation letters translated, and to also insert the BN3 Plus assets in another offset at the very end of the 16mb PT-BR expanded ROM, to ensure proper compatibility with not only the PT-BR translation, but also pretty much any other fan-translations out there.

# Original Readme

## INTRODUCTION

This hack intends to fix some pet peeves I had with Battle Network 3. It will put back the Jack In and NaviCust animations that Capcom USA removed (presumably to save cartridge space, as putting them back in extends the ROM size beyond 8 MB even though the animations are compressed). It also lets you decompress NaviCust programs and it restores the original internet color once you've taken down the final boss of the main story.

## FEATURES:

- Adds the Jack In and NaviCust animations back in from the Japanese versions.
- Lets you "decompress" NaviCust programs by re-entering their compression code.
- Restores the original internet color when you've beaten the final boss.

## SOURCE:

Source is included in this folder. Do whatever you want with it. Use Kingcom's ARMIPS to compile. Specifically, I used ARMIPS v0.7c.
